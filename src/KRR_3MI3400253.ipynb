This book follows the story of a rich boy named Amir who grows up playing with his buddy Hassan who is the son of his father's servant. This story is one of friendship, betrayal, love, redemption, and family. There were so many different twists in this book that I never saw coming. It was also so real that I had to Google, \\\"Is The Kite Runner based on a true story?\\\" If you are wondering, no, it is not.Honestly, this book was so moving and beautiful that I was crying at multiple spots in the book. It would be hard to convey how much I love this book. Even typing this review, I am tearing up. Love in real life is not a Hallmark movie or a Lifetime show. Even people we love let us down and disappoint from time to time. The world doesn't always give us an easy hand in life.

That is the determination of many in the small town, yet Gamache wants to look deeper. I really liked number two in the series yet this continuation lacked the same punch. It\\°31s more character driven with the plot revolving around the central players. Even with my familiarity, I was less interested in the asides and wanted more mystery and action.\n",
      "* Owlready * Adding relation onto.review2 description This was a pleasure to read. Imagine a detective who is happily married and is not an alcoholic! Discovering Chief Inspector Armand Gamache is a pleasure in itself!\\nI really enjoyed the setting, a small town in Quebec, and I became quite attached to several of the characters. They were quirky and a couple verged on going over the top but overall the author held it together.An easy, comfortable read with just a bit of bite to it to keep it interesting. Consider me hooked on the series:)\n",
      "* Owlready * Adding relation onto.review1 description WOW! This book was beautiful, exquisite. This book follows the story of a rich boy named Amir who grows up playing with his buddy Hassan who is the son of his father\\'s servant. This story is one of friendship, betrayal, love, redemption, and family. There were so many different twists in this book that I never saw coming. It was also so real that I had to Google, \\\"Is The Kite Runner based on a true story?\\\" If you are wondering, no, it is not.Honestly, this book was so moving and beautiful that I was crying at multiple spots in the book. It would be hard to convey how much I love this book. Even typing this review, I am tearing up. Love in real life is not a Hallmark movie or a Lifetime show. Even people we love let us down and disappoint from time to time. The world doesn\\'t always give us an easy hand in life. However, this author perfectly depicted imperfect characters who were doing their best.\n"
